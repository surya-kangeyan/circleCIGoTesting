# Extended CircleCI Configuration Files

CircleCI doesn't technically support multiple configuration files. However, this example project maintains these additional example configuration files for reference.

These extended configuration files are usually additional steps or jobs that could be added to the default config file, `.circleci/config.yml`.

Each of these configuration files are tested and verified on every pull request.
